# ANDCaT
Automated Network Device Configuration and Telemetry | Version 1
Hey guys, this project was made to help gather data from network devices and insert the data dynamically into a database. The script converts lists of dictionaries into SQL insert statements. There is a SQL schema included, along with the ANDCaT.py script.
